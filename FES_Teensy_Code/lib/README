control - describes the control code used to calculate PID constraints and adjust the PWM accordingly

definitions - sets the pin definitions and variable declarations for all hardware/software functionality

readADC - customized code used to communicate with our ADC to read voltages, output can be changed to reflect the binary reading, resolution reading, 
low voltage reading or converted high voltage reading

safetyDrain - this code drains all capactitors through a resistor bank to safely discharge all active parts of the high voltage circuit

stringParsingFunctions - functions to communicate with the user on the computer side or decipher commands
