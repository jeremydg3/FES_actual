Currently the Code does not support commands.  However, there are functions included, that once completed, will alow the user to control the PID constraints to control the voltage output,
change the amount of voltage output from the High Voltage converter, and switch the relays on and off.  In the main.cpp file, there is a commented out block of code with the routine
that will control the process of power transferring between the Capacitor bank and the DEA.

THIS CODE IS NOT FINAL AND WILL NOT WORK AS EXPECTED DUE TO HANG UPS WITH THE PROTOTYPING BOARD.

The code is ready but please do not run until the board is complete.
